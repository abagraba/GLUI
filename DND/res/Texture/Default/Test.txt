//This file encodes Texture definitions for use in embedding into a TEX file.
//All Tokens must be in the form 
//key : value
//No whitespace allowed before the key or after the value.

//This is a comment.

//Allowable Definitions are:
//Width: Set the number of tiles to subdivide the texture into horizontally. All Definitions after this declaration will use this width.
//Height: Set the number of tiles to subdivide the texture into Vertically. All Definitions after this declaration will use this width.
//Type: Set the target of the texture. Valid values are 1D, 2D, 3D, 1DARRAY, 2DARRAY, CUBE, CUBEARRAY.
//Filter: Set the filter of the texture. Valid values are NEAREST, LINEAR, NEAREST NEAREST, NEAREST LINEAR, LINEAR NEAREST, LINEAR LINEAR.

//Any other definitions are considered texture definitions of the form 
//TextureName : tileOffset
